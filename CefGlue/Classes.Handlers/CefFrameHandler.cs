    /// <summary>
    /// Implement this interface to handle events related to CefFrame life span. The
    /// order of callbacks is:
    /// (1) During initial CefBrowserHost creation and navigation of the main frame:
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameCreated => The initial main frame object has been
    /// created. Any commands will be queued until the frame is attached.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnMainFrameChanged => The initial main frame object has
    /// been assigned to the browser.
    /// - CefLifeSpanHandler::OnAfterCreated => The browser is now valid and can be
    /// used.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameAttached => The initial main frame object is now
    /// connected to its peer in the renderer process. Commands can be routed.
    /// (2) During further CefBrowserHost navigation/loading of the main frame
    /// and/or sub-frames:
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameCreated => A new main frame or sub-frame object
    /// has been created. Any commands will be queued until the frame is attached.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameAttached => A new main frame or sub-frame object
    /// is now connected to its peer in the renderer process. Commands can be
    /// routed.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameDetached => An existing main frame or sub-frame
    /// object has lost its connection to the renderer process. If multiple
    /// objects are detached at the same time then notifications will be sent for
    /// any sub-frame objects before the main frame object. Commands can no longer
    /// be routed and will be discarded.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnMainFrameChanged => A new main frame object has been
    /// assigned to the browser. This will only occur with cross-origin navigation
    /// or re-navigation after renderer process termination (due to crashes, etc).
    /// (3) During final CefBrowserHost destruction of the main frame:
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameDetached => Any sub-frame objects have lost their
    /// connection to the renderer process. Commands can no longer be routed and
    /// will be discarded.
    /// - CefLifeSpanHandler::OnBeforeClose => The browser has been destroyed.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnFrameDetached => The main frame object have lost its
    /// connection to the renderer process. Notifications will be sent for any
    /// sub-frame objects before the main frame object. Commands can no longer be
    /// routed and will be discarded.
    /// - CefFrameHandler::OnMainFrameChanged => The final main frame object has
    /// been removed from the browser.
    /// Cross-origin navigation and/or loading receives special handling.
    /// When the main frame navigates to a different origin the OnMainFrameChanged
    /// callback (2) will be executed with the old and new main frame objects.
    /// When a new sub-frame is loaded in, or an existing sub-frame is navigated to,
    /// a different origin from the parent frame, a temporary sub-frame object will
    /// first be created in the parent's renderer process. That temporary sub-frame
    /// will then be discarded after the real cross-origin sub-frame is created in
    /// the new/target renderer process. The client will receive cross-origin
    /// navigation callbacks (2) for the transition from the temporary sub-frame to
    /// the real sub-frame. The temporary sub-frame will not recieve or execute
    /// commands during this transitional period (any sent commands will be
    /// discarded).
    /// When a new popup browser is created in a different origin from the parent
    /// browser, a temporary main frame object for the popup will first be created
    /// in the parent's renderer process. That temporary main frame will then be
    /// discarded after the real cross-origin main frame is created in the
    /// new/target renderer process. The client will recieve creation and initial
    /// navigation callbacks (1) for the temporary main frame, followed by
    /// cross-origin navigation callbacks (2) for the transition from the temporary
    /// main frame to the real main frame. The temporary main frame may receive and
    /// execute commands during this transitional period (any sent commands may be
    /// executed, but the behavior is potentially undesirable since they execute in
    /// the parent browser's renderer process and not the new/target renderer
    /// process).
    /// Callbacks will not be executed for placeholders that may be created during
    /// pre-commit navigation for sub-frames that do not yet exist in the renderer
    /// process. Placeholders will have CefFrame::GetIdentifier() == -4.
    /// The methods of this class will be called on the UI thread unless otherwise
    /// indicated.
