# Linux

While porting CefGlue to Linux we tested on these platforms and confirmed to be working:

 - Arch Linux (rolling release, packages up-to-date as on 29 July 2024) on x64
 - Debian 12 on x64
 - Kylin V10 on ARM64 (see issues below)

## ARM64 Issues

We have not found the i≈üsue why dynamic loading CEF is failing with "cannot allocate memory in static TLS block" and currently our guess is that CLR uses too much TLS. 
Loading CEf with `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable works but needs to load HarfBuzzSharp first (`LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libHarfBuzzSharp.so:/path/to/libcef.so`).

One can also modify the ELF files using these commands before running their CefGlue application for CEF to load correctly:
````bash
patchelf --add-needed libHarfBuzzSharp.so --add-needed libcef.so path/to/Xilium.CefGlue.Demo.Avalonia
patchelf --add-needed libcef.so path/to/Xilium.CefGlue.BrowserProcess
# Browser process doesn't use Avalonia, so there's no need to add libHarfBuzzSharp.so
````
